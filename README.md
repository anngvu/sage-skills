# Sage skills

This is an open-source side project for data-driven skills development at Sage. 
The skills data model uses https://lightcast.io/open-skills.

## Framework for learning new skills

This is a tentative framework for skills learning and career development. 
How should you prioritize and assess skills learning? 
Some factors so far:
- How relevant it is to your role
- How relevant it is to the project you're on (even if it may be outside your role)
- How many people are actually available to help you with development of this skill
- How valuable it is _currently_ based on current market data
- How valuable it will be in the future based on projected data (this could account for AI risk)
- How much it inherently interests you/how much you'll enjoy it


## Self-assessment levels

0. You're not really sure what this skill is/has never really been exposed to it.
1. You at least understand what this is and how it is used at Sage (you understand context and relevance).
2. You can somewhat work with this skill.
3. You are more comfortable working with this skill.
4. You can help others with this skill.

...

10. You are a thought leader in this and others outside the company ask you to give talks or consult on it.
