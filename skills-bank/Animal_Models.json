{"category":{"id":[30],"name":["Science and Research"]},"description":["An animal model is a living, non-human, often genetic-engineered animal used during the research and investigation of human disease, for the purpose of better understanding the disease process without the risk of harming a human. Although biological activity in an animal model does not ensure an effect in humans, many drugs, treatments and cures for human diseases are developed in part with the guidance of animal models. Animal models representing specific taxonomic groups in the research and study of developmental processes are also referred to as model organisms. There are three main types of animal models: Homologous, Isomorphic and Predictive.\nHomologous animals have the same causes, symptoms and treatment options as would humans who have the same disease.\nIsomorphic animals share the same symptoms and treatments, only.\nPredictive models are similar to a particular human disease in only a couple of aspects.
