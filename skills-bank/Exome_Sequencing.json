It consists of two steps: the first step is to select only the subset of DNA that encodes proteins. These regions are known as exons – humans have about 180,000 exons, constituting about 1% of the human genome, or approximately 30 million base pairs. The second step is to sequence the exonic DNA using any high-throughput DNA sequencing technology."],"descriptionSource":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exome_sequencing"],"id":["KS123QY691LRKGSJRSMS"],"infoUrl":["https://skills.emsidata.com/skills/KS123QY691LRKGSJRSMS"],"isLanguage":[false],"isSoftware":[false],"name":["Exome Sequencing"],"removedDescription":{},"subcategory":{"id":[620],"name":["Genetics"]},"tags":[{"key":["wikipediaExtract"],"value":["Exome sequencing, also known as whole exome sequencing (WES), is a genomic technique for sequencing all of the protein-coding regions of genes in a genome.
